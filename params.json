{"name":"KonatoK GitHub Page","tagline":"Github Pages","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful \r\npages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using \r\nGitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and \r\npublish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and \r\nyou'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and \r\ncontinue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to \r\nedit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can \r\nrevisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page \r\ncontent will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named \r\n`gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to \r\nsupporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, \r\nblog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. \r\nJekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without \r\nhaving to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog \r\nsupport and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. \r\nThe resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub \r\nProfile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett \r\n(@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
